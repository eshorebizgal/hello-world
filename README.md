Learning how to use Github and Git

Hi 

My name is Ruth and I am learning how to use Github so I will not pull my hair out wihen I am making changes to various themes. I also use it when building new themes for the same reason.  I have been working with web development and Wordpress for a few years now and just love what can be accomplished with a little code and patience.
